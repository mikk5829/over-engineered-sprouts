## Testing framework

We are using **Mocha** as our testing framework, see the files `sum.js` and `sumTest.js` for inspiration or check out [this guide](https://blog.logrocket.com/a-quick-and-complete-guide-to-mocha-testing-d0e0ea09f09d/) or [this official guide](https://mochajs.org/#assertions) 

## Setting up db on local machine

4. Add file ```database.json``` to ```routes/```
2. It just works!
